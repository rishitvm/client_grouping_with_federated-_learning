# client_grouping_with_federated-_learning
This project aims at grouping clients based on the data they provide. The model learns and updates the clusters dynamically whenever new data comes and this entire process is implemented by using Federated Learning which helps to secure individual client's data and also reduces the resource cost required to some extent.
