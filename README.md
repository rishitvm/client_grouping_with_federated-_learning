# Overview
This project aims to group clients based on the data they provide. The model learns and updates clusters dynamically as new data arrives, implementing Federated Learning to ensure the security of individual clients' data while reducing resource costs. This approach is particularly relevant in the networking field.

# Features
- Dynamic Clustering: Automatically updates client clusters with incoming data.
- Federated Learning: Secures client data and minimizes resource usage by training models locally.
- Scalable Solution: Designed to handle a growing number of clients and data points.
  
# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow or PyTorch
- Scikit-learn
- NumPy

# How It Works
The model utilizes Federated Learning to create and update clusters of clients based on the data they provide. By training locally on client devices, the model secures sensitive data while allowing for efficient updates to clustering as new data is available.
